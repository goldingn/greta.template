This is an empty repository to help you build an extension to greta. It's a [GitHub template repository](https://github.blog/2019-06-06-generate-new-repositories-with-repository-templates/), so you can make a copy to build your extension from by following these steps:

 1. Click *Use this template* to the left of *Clone or download*.
 ![template](https://i.imgur.com/TcLpIvM.png)
 1. Give this repo a new name (preferably `greta.<something>`) and create a new repo in your account.
 1. Clone the repository and start filling out all the fields to make the package your own. See Jenny Bryan's [happy git with R](https://happygitwithr.com/push-pull-github.html) if you'd like some help with this.

**Please don't hit the fork button**, that would make a permanent link between your repository and this one!

#### to do list

Here's a list of things to do once you've made a copy of the template, to make sure the package is ship-shape. Maybe take a look at the corresponding parts of [greta](https://github.com/greta-dev/greta) or [tensorflow](https://github.com/rstudio/tensorflow) if you need inspiration or text to copy and adapt!

 - [ ] Pick a package name (preferably with 'greta.' at the beginning). Update the package name in:
    - [ ] the 'Package' field in  `DESCRIPTION`
    - [ ] the `library()` and `test_check()` calls in `tests/testthat.R`
    - [ ] in the `@name` documentation field in `R/package.R`
    - [ ] at the top of `README.Rmd`
    - [ ] the repo name (if it changed since you made it)
 - [ ] Come up with a helpful package title. Add it to:
    - [ ] the 'Title' field in `DESCRIPTION`
    - [ ] the `@title` documentation field in `R/package.R`
    - [ ] at the top of your GitHub repo 
 - [ ] Fill in the the author details in `DESCRIPTION`
 - [ ] Update the 'URL' and 'BugReports' fields in `DESCRIPTION` to point to your repo
 - [ ] Decide what sort of license you want to use for your package (you are completely free to change the CC0 license in the template). See [https://choosealicense.com]() or  [r-pkgs.org](https://r-pkgs.org/description.html#license) for help choosing.
 - [ ] Write short paragraph describing the package. Copy it to:
    - [ ] the 'Description' field of `DESCRIPTION`
    - [ ] the `@description` documentation field of `R/package.R` 
 - [ ] Log in to [travis](https://travis-ci.org) (e.g. with your GitHub credentials) and turn on tracking of your new repo
 - [ ] Edit the commented-out travis badge in `README.Rmd` to point to your package
 - [ ] Write a simple example introducing the package and add it to `R/package.R`
 - [ ] Update `README.Rmd` to sell to people with a sales pitch and maybe an example that creates a figure, to get people excited about your package.
 - [ ] Start adding functions to the package, along with documentation and examples!
