This is an empty repository to help automating extensions to greta. It’s
a [GitHub template
repository](https://github.blog/2019-06-06-generate-new-repositories-with-repository-templates/),
so you can make a copy to build your extension from by following these
steps:

1.  Click *Use this template* to the left of *Clone or download*.

2.  Give this repo a new name (preferably `greta.<something>`) and
    create a new repo in your account.
3.  Clone the repository and start filling out all the fields to make
    the package your own. See Jenny Bryan’s [happy git with
    R](https://happygitwithr.com/push-pull-github.html) if you’d like
    some help with this.

**Please don’t hit the fork button**, that would make a link between
your repository and this one
